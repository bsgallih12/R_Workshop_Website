title: "R for Statistical Analysis"
---

Welcome to this R workshop reference website! Here you will find all information covered in the R workshop in both a website form and a downloadable PDF form for easy reference. I hope you found the R workshop helpful and I encourage everyone to provide feedback so that I can improve should I run other R workshops in the future.

### A Thank You To Andy Field and Colleagues (2012)
This work (and much of the code) would not have been possible without fantastic "Discovering Statistics Using R" by Field et al (2012) as a reference guide (found [here](https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/discovering-statistics-using-r/)) for myself. This book is a fantastic resource for anyone interested in doing data analysis in R
