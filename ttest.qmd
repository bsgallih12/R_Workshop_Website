## An Introduction to T-tests

## Assumptions of T-tests

### Normality of Residuals

```{r normality of residuals}
library(tidyverse)

data <- starwars %>% 
  filter(sex == "male" | sex == "female") # <1> 

model <- lm(height ~ sex, data = data) # <2>

residuals <- data.frame(res = residuals(model)) # <3>

problem <- residuals %>% filter(res > 2.5 | res < -2.5) # <4>

nrow(problem)/nrow(data) 
```
1. Filtering for male the female using the `filter()` function
2. Running a linear regression (that is a t-test here) to get residuals
3. Calculate residuals for the observations
4. Find potentially problematic observations
5. Check for percent of cases (> 5% is not ideal)

#### Graphical Depiction of Normality of Residuals

```{r residual graph}
residual_graph <- ggplot(residuals,aes(x = res)) + # <1>
  geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density))) +  # <2>
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, # <3>
                args = list(mean = mean(residuals$res), # <3>
                            sd = sd(residuals$res)), # <3>
                col = "blue", # <3>
                linewidth = 1) + # <3>
  theme_classic() # <3>

print(residual_graph) # <4>
```

1. We are plotting the residuals here. We give ggplot a `geom` (i.e., histogram)
2. We also give some other arguments like a density distribution.
3. Here we are basically providing what is needed to draw a normal distribution given the data using the `stat_function()` function. The `col` and `linewidth` arguments simply change the colr and size of the normal curve. The `theme_classic()` just changes some aesthetic things. I personally prefer this theme for all ggplot2 graphs
4. `print` will show us the graph output

#### Statistical Depiction of Normality of Residuals

We can also test the assumption statistically using the `shapiro.test()` function here

```{r residuals stats}
shapiro.test(residuals$res)
```

### Homogeneity of Variance

Homogeneity of variance is important even for a basic t-test. Below is how we might go about testing this assumption.

#### Graphical Depiction of Homogeneity of Variance

```{r homogeneity graphical}
variance_boxplot <- ggplot(data,aes(x = sex, # <1>
                               y = height)) +  # <1>
  geom_boxplot() + # <2>
  theme_classic() # <2>

print(variance_boxplot)
```

1. Graphically we can represent this as a boxplot with the group variable as the `x` and the outcome as the `y`. We see this here
2. We again provide a `geom` for ggplot2 to use and provide a `theme()` choice here

#### Statistical Depiction of Homogeneity of Variance

We can also test the assumption using the Bartlett test. This can be shown below

```{r homogeneity statistic}
bartlett.test(height ~ sex,data)
```

## Running a T-test

```{r t test run}
t.test(height ~ sex, data = data) # <1>
```
1. The `t.test()` function will take a DV and IV argument as well as the dataframe used. We can see this here
